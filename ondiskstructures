for any ordered bytes, they are converted to little endian for disk or network
sstable:
# keys as u64, [(key_len as u64, key)] <- sparse index
[(block_len, [(key_len as u64, key, value_len as u64, value)])] <- datablocks

proposal: put index after datablocks (will need to put datablocks len before datablocks to seek over that)
so we can simplify compaction implementation
(rethink this? )
