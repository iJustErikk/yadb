for any ordered bytes, they are converted to little endian for disk or network
sstable:
[(block_len, [(key_len as u64, key, value_len as u64, value)])] <- datablocks
[(key_len as u64, key)] <- sparse index
byte offset for sparse index

The index is placed after the datablocks to simplify compaction implementation.
This seems similar to the rocksdb implementation.
