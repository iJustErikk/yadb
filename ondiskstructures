for any ordered bytes, they are converted to little endian for disk or network
sstable:
# bytes for datablocks, [(block_len, [(key_len as u64, key, value_len as u64, value)])] <- datablocks
# bytes for index, [(key_len as u64, key)] <- sparse index

The index is placed after the datablocks to simplify compaction implementation.
