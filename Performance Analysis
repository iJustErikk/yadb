Update: Running 5000 kv benchmark with more keys/values has the performance at 1829 ops/second (with wal flush, on smallest codespaces instance). The previous benchmark was too small (219 keys).
Update: Running locally takes much longer. Why? WAL appends/fsync is unreasonably slow.

TODO: Look at profile again
