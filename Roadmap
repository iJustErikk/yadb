Implementing all of these is time consuming. Need to prioritize so I can implement distributed kv store (almost ready)/sql database (need db iterator, performance enhancements)
TODO:
- asyncify code (use tokio)
- implement compaction
- implement custom merge operator
- utilize bloom filters on reads
- implement filter/index/block cache
- extract magic variables to config (in cargo.toml)
- extend errors so they are more actionable
- write fuzzer
- create/find benchmarks
- profile and see what is taking so long
- eliminate needless copies
- implement iterator
- implement multithreaded compaction
- abstract away compaction logic (for potentially more compactions)
- abstract away touching any files
- implement multithreaded writes/reads
- rate limit compaction (static, additive/multiplicative increase, multiplicative decrease)
- support tables? (see whether pebble does this)
- compression
- checksums
- more stuff for dbs (merkle tree differences, transactions, configuring WAL log so it can hook up to replication logs like Raft)
- more verification
- monitoring
- multiget/multiput (see rocksdb)
