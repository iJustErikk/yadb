Implementing all of these is time consuming. Need to prioritize so I can implement distributed kv store (almost ready)/sql database (need db iterator, performance enhancements)
TODO:
- profile and see what is taking so long (wal appends + fsync)
- utilize bloom filters on reads (these seem to be nondeterministic, need to debug)
- implement iterator (when do iterators become invalid? should I go about a similar scheme to rocksdb (where iterators block operations that invalidate them)? how would I implement that?)
- create/find benchmarks
- implement filter/index/block cache (need to undo mem::replace for datablocks)

TODO LATER (NEEDS PRIORITIZATION):

- verify db durability + implement FS level manifest WAL to handle non atomic FS operations (varies OS to OS, everything should be atomic if POSIX compliant)
- make code structure follow rust file structure
- asyncify code (use tokio)
- eliminate needless copies (is this done)
- implement custom merge operator
- extract magic variables to config (in cargo.toml)
- extend errors so they are more actionable
- implement multithreaded compaction
- write fuzzer
- abstract away compaction logic (for potentially more compactions)
- abstract away touching any files
- implement multithreaded writes/reads
- rate limit compaction (static, additive/multiplicative increase, multiplicative decrease)
- support tables
- compression
- checksums
- more stuff for dbs (merkle tree differences, transactions, configuring WAL log so it can hook up to replication logs like Raft)
- more verification (both just in time and defensive checks)
- monitoring
- multiget/multiput (see rocksdb)
