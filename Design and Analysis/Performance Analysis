Areas to improve/measure on:

Measure compaction performance
Measure DB scan performance
Reads are slow -> need to measure filter FP rate, do a bit of fine-grained optimization (for example, allocation is taking some time. Is there a better way we could allocate memory?)
Measure tokio/sync overhead
Measure write perf
Gather metrics to better inform profile

What other ways should we look at performance?
